#+Title: RPG Prototype README


* Overview
A basic RPG that has players move through rooms, fight monsters, collect loot, earn exp, and fight a final boss.


** Goals
1) Confidence :: prove to myself and those around me that I can complete a challanging and multi-faceted project on a strict timeline
2) Learning :: deepen my understanding of the C# programming language and the Godot game engine
3) Expression :: take the opportunity to learn and practice visual art
4) Career :: have a project that I can showcase on my resume and as part of a portfolio of work
5) Growth :: provide a space for self reflection so that I may continue to work on becoming the person I wish to be


** Requirments
1) Has a full gameplay loop on the micro and macro level
   + Micro :: players will fight enemies from a top down perspective in real time
   + Macro :: ultimate goal of the player is to navigate the dungeon succsessfully and defeat the final boss
2) Has a UI that clearly displays all information the player needs
   + Health :: should be displayed as a bar with accompying numbers following traditional UI principles
   + Map :: should have a map that clearly displays the near by rooms with some indication that the room has been cleared or not
3) Has at least two (2) types of enemies including the final boss
   + Basic Enemy :: should have relativly low stats; low stakes, low reward enemies
   + "Champion" Enemy :: more difficult enemy with high stats; high stakes, high reward enemy
   + Final Boss :: a unique enemy that fights using the same methods as the player(?)
4) Has a multi-room dungeon that players must move through
   + Progression :: players must defeat the enemies in the current room to progress to new rooms
   + Backtracking :: players may leave a room to go to a previously cleared room at any time but enemies will be reset upon re-entering an uncleared room
   + Navigating :: rooms should have subtle indicators of the direction the player is supposed to go to progress to the final boss


** Questions
1) What is the overall aesthetic/theme of the game (non-critical)
2) Will the players attacks be ranged or melee (critical)
3) Will their be puzzles of some kind (non-critical)
